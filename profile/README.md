# Welcome to the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security Data Repository! 

At CGHSS, we endeavor to mitigate the threat of public health emergencies in the United States and around the world by building the evidence base for informed decision-making and sustainable capacity development. On this github profile, you will find repos dedicated to hosting the data, methods documentation, and reproducible code for many of our projects. A short description of each project is below. 

For more information on our center, visit our [website](https://ghss.georgetown.edu/) or reach out to us at globalhealthsecurity@georgetown.edu

Here are some of our featured tools and datasets. However, we have many other projects and datasets, so please explore our profile! 

### Analysis and Mapping of Policies for Emerging Infectious Diseases

AMP EID provides a landscape assessment of the policies and governance regimes relevant to emerging infectious diseases and outbreak response from all UN Member States. Featured datasets include Vaccination, Access & Benefits Sharing, WASH, Quarantine & Isolation, Military Engagement, TRIPS, and relevant treaty involvement. 

### Analysis and Mapping of Policies for COVID-19

The COVID Analysis and Mapping of Policies (AMP) visualization tool is a comprehensive database of policies and plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision-makers can use COVID AMP’s user-friendly interface to easily identify effective policies and plans to reduce the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Global Health Security Tracking

The Global Health Security Tracking tool is an integrated mapping and data visualization platform showing the flow of international funding for global health security from funder to recipient globally. The tool tracks funding targeted to improve health security core capacities, funds for outbreak response, and health security metrics.

### Health Security Net

Health Security Net is a publicly accessible, centralized database of warnings, evaluations, oversight efforts, strategies, and other documents that relate to pandemics prior to 2020. It provides a readily available source of information for policymakers, researchers, journalists, the general public, and other interested parties to access documents written about pandemic risk in the past; unearth patterns that reveal why response may be insufficient to date; and develop improved policies for the future.

### Georgetown Outbreak Activity Library

The Georgetown Outbreak Activity Library (GOAL) provides rapid access and search for a comprehensive library of the activities required for response to disease outbreaks, including case studies, information about the stakeholders, and guidance mapped to each activity.

### Epidemic EM

Effectively responding to and managing the COVID-19 pandemic requires close operational coordination across sectors. These response efforts rely on the key principles of emergency management, including coordination of efforts as typically managed by Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs). This site, developed by Georgetown University and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides rapid access to training materials, checklists, and other resources for development and strengthening of public health emergency management capacities, with an emphasis on EOCs.

### Georgetown Bioscenarios

Bioscenarios is a rapid visualization tool demonstrating the diversity in biological outbreak scenarios, each coded by 12 characteristics and ranked by relative likelihood to cause fatalities in humans and animals.

### Deliberate Biological Event Tool

Deliberate Biological Event (DBE) Tool is an interactive teaching tool that aligns policies with the stakeholders mandated or authorized to act in responding to a deliberate biological outbreak (e.g., bioterror or state-sponsored attack), including a static visualization of how nations can request assistance for such events. Each policy is associated with when during an outbreak it is triggered and the responsibilities associated with organizations from different sectors affected by the policy in response to a DBE.

### IHR Costing Tool

The IHR Costing Tool helps users generate and review cost estimates to support practical planning for sustainable capacity development to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats, as defined by the International Health Regulations (IHR). This tool provides a framework to calculate costs for implementing and enhancing IHR core capacities. Costs are estimated by applying country-specific user input data to cost calculations developed using best practices for achieving the technical standards specified in the Joint External Evaluation Tool (JEE).

### Integrated Neglected Tropical Diseases Tool

The Integrated NTD (Neglected Tropical Diseases) Tool is a web-based decision support tool to aid policy makers in decisions regarding the benefits of integrating malaria and schistosomiasis control programs. The user interface translates epidemiological parameters into easily interpretable recommendations.

### Disease Outbreak News Tool

We have migrated several decades of WHO’s prose reports of Disease Outbreak News (DON) into a searchable spreadsheet. The data are now organized by a comprehensive data structure for consistent naming conventions for countries, outbreaks, type of disease event, and standard outbreak measures.
